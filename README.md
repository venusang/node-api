# node-api
My first hand at writing a Node.js API with MongoDB and Express

## Build Setup
``` bash
#download repo and unzip
cd to node-api-master

#install using npm
npm install

#request for db.js file - application will not work otherwise
This application requires a file in /config/db.js that contains credentials in order to access a remote database hosted at mlab.com.
Please contact me if you would like to request access and I will set-up user credentials for the database and send the db.js file to you.

#run app - it should run on http://localhost:8000/
npm run dev
